## Manual Build

<br />

### 1. Environment Set Up for `Windows`, `Unix`, `MacOS`

<br />

> **Step 1** Download the code 

```bash
$ git clone https://github.com/emmar266/Restaurant.git
$ cd Restaurant
```

<br />

> **Step 2** - Create a `virtual environment`

> Install modules via `VENV` 

```bash
$ py -3 -m venv venv
```

<br />

> **Step 3** - Activate the `virtual environment`

```bash
$ .\venv\Scripts\activate 
```

<br />

> **Step 4** - Install the dependencies

> Install modules via `VENV`

```bash
$ pip install -r requirements.txt
```

<br />

### 2. Connect to a database

<br />

> **Step 1** - Create a python file called `credentials.py`

> **Step 2** - Create four variables as follows, and populate with your details

```python 
1 user="your_user"
2 host="your_host"
3 db="your_database"
4 password="your_password" 
```

<br />

### 3. Set up for database

<br />

> **Step 1** - Copy all the SQL from `schema.sql`, located in the root directory of this project
> Then paste the code in your preferred editor for SQL development

> **Step 2** - Run the code once in your editor to populate your schema

<br />

### 4. Set up for `Flask-Mail`

<br />

> **Step 1** - Go to your newly created python file called credentials.py

> **Step 2** - Add in two new variables and fill in your details as follows:

```python 
5 flask_email='your_email'
6 flask_email_password='password_generated_by_google_that_is_usable_by_3rd_party_apps'
```

  # do i write about how to generate this password

<br />

### 5. Running the application

<br />

> Starting the Flask app

```bash
$ python3 -m flask run
// OR
$ flask run
```

At this point, the app runs at `http://localhost:8080` or `http://127.0.0.1:5000/`

<br />

## Testing  - Set Up for `Windows`, `Unix`, `MacOS`

<br />

> **Step 1** Ensure all dependencies are downloaded

```bash
$ pip install -r requirements.txt
```

<br />

> **Step 2** Run the tests in the terminal

```bash
$ python -m pytest tests/
// OR
$ pytest
```

<br />

### Create Users

By default, the app redirects guest users to authenticate. In order to access the more interesting pages, follow this set up: 

- Start the app via `python3 -m flask run`
- Access the `registration` page and create a new user:
  - `http://127.0.0.1:5000/registration`
- Access the `sign in` page and authenticate
  - `http://127.0.0.1:5000/customer_login`
